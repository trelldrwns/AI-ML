Help the rat escape the unnder ground pipe network

vast underground pipe network is a SSG or a tree

junctions and connections
juntions are states
pipe connections   are edges

edge and junctions havbe costs

crawling through these has costs

path costs more time

write a program to find a path from the starting junction to the end to find the cheese

goal state is the end

and the start state is the first junction


change based on your own interests.

use search algorithms that you think are good

example - breadth first search
          depth first search
          depth limited search
          iterative deepening search
          uniform cost search

input - RHS is important
        no of junctions and pipes
        refer to the problem statement pdf for more info.

ASSIGNMENT ONE INTRODUCTION TO AI & ML.

implement a bot that bascially takes you around the university with a tree path, has 12 nodes, uses search algorithms, refer to PDF.

currently thinking -

MAP the entire university, then make the dictionary with lists, for all the nodes.

post map make classes for all four search algorithms

use classes to sample and get results to check if its working, report here based on efficiency and other parametres.
    time based opening and closing schedule for the buildings

now start with implementing user related tasks
    modifying modules to integrate well with users and queries
    adding ux modules that deal with user queries
        <reserved>
    add all path checking algorithms, most efficient algorithm, etc.

then add any other stuff mentioned in the PDF. <reserved>

start work on ui and implementation of UI elements and Design, etc.
